    "# MotionCommander Manual Control\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial notebook let's you use manually steer your drone using Bitcraze's MotionCommander library. MotionCommander is an abstraction library that makes writing Crazyflie movement scripts easy. \n",
    "\n",
    "MotionCommander requires some sort of positioning hardware support such as the Flow deck. The library does not have a notion of absolute position (such as GPS) and instead uses velocity setpoints. Due to this, the error in position will accumulate over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API contains a set of primitives that are easy to understand and use, such as “go forward” or “turn around”.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two flavors of primitives:\n",
    "1. Actions that are blocking and return when a motion is completed\n",
    "2. Actions that starts a motion and return immediately\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second variation the user has to stop or change the motion when appropriate by issuing new commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MotionCommander can be used as context manager using the with keyword. In this mode of operation takeoff and landing is executed when the context is created/closed.\n",
    "\n",
